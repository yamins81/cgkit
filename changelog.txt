Changelog
=========

Changes from cgkit-2.0.0alpha8 to cgkit-2.0.0alpha9:

New features:

- New module sloargs to parse compiled RenderMan shaders.
- New module pointcloud to read/write RenderMan point cloud files.
- New module sequence that contains functionality to deal with numbered
  (file) sequences. There are also new utilities seqls.py, seqmv.py, seqcp.py
  and seqrm.py (the equivalent of ls, mv, cp, rm but they work on file
  sequences).

Bug fixes/enhancements:

- objimport: Now handles map_bump and bump and map_refl correctly (dyamins)
- suportlib/src/trimeshgeom.cpp:  syntax error preventing installation corrected (dyamins)
- ribexport: A custom rib string can now also be added to light sources
  (for the image pass).
- setup script: In addition to the general config file config.cfg the setup
  script also reads a version-specific config_pyXY.cfg script.
- mat4: Wrapped the mat4 constructor that takes 16 floats as input. Because
  this one was missing, calling copy.copy() on a mat4 that was returned by
  the library (instead of being created by the user) did not work.
- RMShader: Passing parameter values for array parameters in the constructor
  didn't work.
- ri/cri: Added the following calls:
      RiArchiveBegin(), RiArchiveEnd(), RiCamera(), RiDisplayChannel(),
      RiIfBegin(), RiElseIf(), RiElse(), RiIfEnd(),
      RiMakeBrickMap(), RiResource(), RiResourceBegin(), RiResourceEnd(),
      RiScopedCoordinateSystem(), RiShader(), RiSystem().
- cri: numpy integer arrays were not properly supported on 64-bit systems
- mayaascii: Bugfix #2119263: The setAttr command wasn't recognizing the 
  channelBox option (+ some other bugfixes). 
- slparams: The module can now also retrieve information from compiled shaders
  (from various renderers).
- slparams: The returned shader info/shader parameters are no tuples anymore
  but special objects whose attributes hold the return values. For backwards,
  compatibility, those objects can still be used like tuples.
- ObjMaterial: Texture maps were rendered with a filter width of 0.01 which
  doesn't make much sense. For now, I set it to 1.0, but this should probably
  be customizable.
- mat3: The toEuler*() methods were broken. Depending on the angles, they
  could return invalid values.
- sl/noise: When only cgkit light was installed, the sl module couldn't be
  imported because it imports noise which has no pure Python equivalent yet.
  There is a dummy noise module now in the light version which allows importing
  the module. An error is only triggered when one of the functions gets called.
- rply: The sources can now also be compiled using a C++ compiler. Thanks
  to Chris Foster for the patch!
- ribexport: The Frame block now uses the frame number from the timer object
  (instead of always using 0).
- ribexport: Added RenderMan support for the torus geometry.
- cri: Improved library detection (uses renderer-specific environment variables
  to locate the shared RenderMan library)
- ri/cri: Passing unicode strings in a parameter list has caused an exception.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from cgkit-2.0.0alpha7 to cgkit-2.0.0alpha8:

New features:

- New module "cri" that accesses a RenderMan API directly by loading
  a shared library that must implement the API (this shared library has
  to be provided by the renderer you are using).
- New module mayabinary to parse Maya binary scene files

Bug fixes/enhancements:

- ri: RiPixelFilter() now also accepts a callable as filter function but
  will issue a warning and ignore the call.
- ri: RiProcedural() now also accepts a Python function as subdiv function.
  This will simply be called with a detail value of RI_INFINITY.
- ri: Parameter lists can now also contain numpy (or other) arrays (this
  doesn't increase performance though (whereas it does when the cri module
  is used)).
- ri: Added the RenderMan type symbols to the module.
- ri: Bugfix: RiColorSamples() was setting an invalid number of samples
- ri: Bugfix: The RiTrimCurve() function was broken (due to a typo in the spec).
- ri: Parameter lists that are given using positional arguments will now have
  the same order in the RIB as they have in the source code.
- Bugfix 1677388: The debug messages that print pointer now use the format
  string %#lx which should also work on 64Bit systems (thanks to Paul Egan)
- GLRenderInstance: Bugfix: Picking in vsplit stereo mode can now 
  correctly be done on the left image.
- asfamcimport: Updates because the mat3.fromEuler*() methods are now static.
- euleradapter: Updates because the mat3.fromEuler*() methods are now static.
- BoundingBox: New method center() that returns the center of the box.
- BoundingBox: getBounds() now accepts an optional direction that controls
  which corners will get returned.
- BoundingBox: New method clamp() that clamps a point so that it lies
  within the bounding box.
- vec3: The C++ implementation of ortho() is now more stable (now it matches
  the version in the pure Python implementation)
- vec3/vec4: Finished and exposed the min(), max(), minIndex(), maxIndex(),
  minAbs(), maxAbs(), minAbsIndex() and maxAbsIndex() methods.
- quat: New method rotateVec() to rotate a vector about a unit quaternion.
- mat3: New static method fromToRotation() to create a rotation matrix that 
  rotates one vector into another.
- mat3: Bugfix: There was a typo in toEulerZYX() which has led to incorrect
  results.
- mat3: identity(), scaling(), rotation() and the fromEuler*() methods are 
  now static methods, so you don't have to create a temporary instance 
  anymore just to invoke those methods. Note: fromEuler*() now just returns
  a rotation matrix but does not initialize self anymore!
- mat4: identity(), scaling(), rotation(), frustum(), perspective(), 
  orthographic() and lookAt() are now static methods, so you don't have
  to create a temporary instance anymore just to invoke those methods.
  (in cgkit light, mat4 was modifying self. This has been changed so that
  it matches the regular version)
- mat3/mat4/vec3 (light version): The methods taking a vec3 now also
  accept any other 3-sequence of floats (as the regular version is already
  doing).
- quat (light version): Added the "shortest" argument (as done in the
  previous release with the regular version).
- Bugfix: The render tool wasn't properly processing facevarying/facevertex
  variables on meshes (the extractUniform() function didn't take these
  storage classes into account).
- mayaascii: When several MEL commands were in the same line it could happen
  that they were not properly distinguished. Added some more doc-strings and
  issue a warning when an unknown MEL command is encountered. 
  When no type information was passed to Attribute.getValue() it falls
  back to string conversion when the initially guessed type this fail.
- mayaascii: The options of the file command have been completed.
- mayaascii: The lockNode command is supported.
- mayaascii: Reading the file can be aborted.
- mayaascii: The importer was broken because of the previous modification
  of the simplecpp module. This is fixed now.
- render.py: The Globals section can now contain a parameter output_framebuffer
  that controls whether a framebuffer display is opened or not.
- simplecpp: Reading a file can be aborted now.
- simplecpp: Don't use keyword arguments to pass the compare function to
  sort(). This wasn't supported before Python 2.4.
- ribexport: All RMLightSource instances were using the same shader as the
  first RM light source that was encountered during export.
- cmds.load(): When the importer raises an error the original current 
  directory is restored.

Thanks to Martin Blais for pointing out a lot of the above issues!

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from cgkit-2.0.0alpha6 to cgkit-2.0.0alpha7:

New features:

- The license has changed. Instead of the LGPL cgkit now uses the
  MPL/GPL/LGPL tri-license (this applies to the Python package "cgkit").
  The Maya package und plugin uses the MPL.
- New class MayaSpotLight that approximates spot lights as they appear
  in Maya. The object is created by the ma importer.

Bug fixes/enhancements:

- simplecpp: The built-in preprocessor (which is used for parsing RenderMan
  shaders) is now a bit more capable than before (but it's still not a full 
  replacement for a true preprocessor).
  It now handles line-continuation, preprocessor directives and macros
  that do not take arguments.
  The slparams.slparams() function and the RMShader constructor now have
  new arguments 'includedirs' and 'defines' which are passed to the
  preprocessor (either the built-in one or the external one).
- setup.py: The setup script doesn't check for the Boost.Python header
  anymore because the test didn't take the built-in paths (such as
  /usr/include) into account.
- quat: By default, the slerp() function now always interpolates along
  the shortest path. The function has a new optional argument "shortest"
  (default: True) that controls this behavior. If you set shortest to
  False you will get the previous behavior where it depends on the
  quaternions if you get the shortest or longest path (you can switch
  between those paths by negating one of the quaternions).
  This fixes "bug" 1488467.
- Wherever a wrapped C++ function was expecting a vec3/vec4 as input it 
  is now also possible to pass a sequence with 3/4 floats.
- RMShader: Array parameters can now be processed as well.
- A Globals section can now appear more than once without that it resets
  some of the scene values (like the up vector or handedness).
- The built-in materials (GLMaterial, Material3DS, OBJMaterial) can now
  also be used for baking.
- Bugfix: When baking maps, the transformation of the object was ignored.
  This led to incorrect surface shading when the transformation was 
  anything else than the identity.
- WorldObjects now support comparison (i.e. two WorldObject wrappers that
  reference the same C++ object will now appear as identical)
- The setup script was checking for Boost.Python headers even when the
  'light' version was installed. This is fixed.
- Using the GLMaterial class for RenderMan renders was broken (because
  it was still assumed a GLMaterial can only have one texture)
- RMShader: The declare() method did not work when the name argument
  didn't contain an inline declaration and the parameter name started
  with a SL type (such as "colorscale").

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from cgkit-2.0.0alpha5 to cgkit-2.0.0alpha6:

New features:

- New module "glslangparams" to extract uniform, attribute and varying
  variables from OpenGL 2 shaders.
- New module "glslangtokenize" to create tokens from an OpenGL 2 shader file
- New module "lwob" to read Lightwave Object files.
- New *.lwo import plugin using the lwob module
- GLMaterial: The material can now store more than just one texture.
- GLMaterial: New attribute vertex_shader and fragment_shader that take
  a list of GLShader objects (this is in preparation for OpenGL 2.0 shader
  support)
- New module hammersley that contains generators for the Hammersley and Halton
  point sets
- New module stitch.py that can stitch together images that were rendered
  with RiCropWindow(). The file can also be used as a command line utility.
- render.py: An image can now be rendered in tiles by specifying the 
  global 'tiles' parameter. The output image is automatically stitched
  back together. Note: Currently, this feature is only meant to be used
  with renders that only contain one frame block which outputs an image
  (i.e. the tiling will not be applied on shadow maps and any map generation
  pass will be done again for each tile).
- RIBExport: The Globals section can have a 'rib' parameter containing raw
  RIB requests. This string is added to the output RIB stream before the 
  frames.
- RIBExport: The output parameter can also contain a list of output specifiers
  (i.e. containing the parameters for RiDisplay() calls).
- slparams: The slparams() function can now also take a file-like object
  as input instead of a shader source file. If the cpp argument is a callable
  it must accept a stream as second parameter which has to be used for
  error messages.
- RMShader: New method declare() to declare shader parameters if the shader
  source file is not available. New constructor argument 'params' to pass
  a dictionary with parameters. Additional token/value pairs are now only
  allowed if they're passed as keyword arguments. Positional arguments are
  no longer supported as this will break too easily if new constructor
  arguments are introduced.
- The cmds.group() function now returns the newly created Group object.
- New function cmds.fitCone() that generates a minimal cone that entirely
  contains the bounding box of an object (for use with spot lights).

Bug fixes/enhancements:

- objmtl: Added support for lines (l) and points (p).
- sltokenize: Variables whose name started with a SL type were not treated
  correctly.
- GLRenderer: Added a switch to enable backface culling
- Expressions: Expressions can now also take arbitrary Python objects as
  variables.
- RIBExport: The pixel filter can now be set via a global option.
- ri.py: Speedup when processing parameter lists that contain vec3 objects.
- ri.py: Floats are now written using str() instead of repr(), this means
  they are often shorter (e.g. 0.1 instead of 0.10000000000000001). 
  Bugfix: Long integer values did generate invalid RIB code (as the trailing
  'L' was present).  
  Bugfix: Since Python 2.3 boolean values are printed as True and
  False instead of 1 and 0, so RiMatte() was generating invalid RIB code.  
- setup.py: The boost header check is now performed by searching in the
  paths specified in INC_DIRS instead of a path based on BOOST_BASE.
  New config variable BOOST_LIB that carries the name of the Boost.Python
  library to link with.
- events.py: Fixed a typo that led to a deprecation warning at runtime.
- render tool: Fixed the invalid output file names when an animation is 
  rendered.
- MotionPath: Check and handle an exception when the first derivative is zero.
- render.py: The image resolution can now also be specified on the command
  line (bug 1429607).
- viewer.py: Outputs OpenGL information in verbose mode

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from cgkit-2.0.0alpha4 to cgkit-2.0.0alpha5:

New features:

- New class MotionPath that allows animating an object along a path
- New classes: BezierCurveGeom/BezierCurve
- ODEDynamics: If the parameter collision_events is set to True the component
  will generate events whenever a collision occurs.
- ODEDynamics: The ODEBodyManipulator can now also be used to set the 
  bodie's position/orientation/velocities directly. It can also be used
  to change the initial position/orientation/velocities of the body.
- Introduced a 'light' version of cgkit that does not have any external
  dependencies (you don't even need a C/C++ compiler to install the light
  version). Basically, you get the functionality from cgkit1 and a few
  modules from cgkit2. The light version is installed by setting the
  INSTALL_CGKIT_LIGHT variable to True in your config.cfg file.
- Package structure: Importing from cgkit directly (e.g. "from cgkit import *")
  does NOT import all the symbols anymore. Instead you have to do that via
  "from cgkit.all import *" (which also imports the contents of the cmds 
  module) or import from the appropriate module directly.
  As importing "cgkit" is now very light weight, you can import selected
  modules very fast (e.g. "from cgkit.ri import *") and this doesn't trigger
  importing all the other stuff which might not necessary if only one module
  is required. This also removes dependencies (from stuff like PyOpenGL, PIL,
  PyProtocols, etc.) if only some basic modules are imported.
  Furthermore the dependencies on PyOpenGL and PIL have been delayed so that
  an exception is only raised when these packages are actually *used* and
  not when they are only imported.
- WorldObject: The visible flag now only applies to the local geometry and
  is not inherited by the children (which has always been the case with the
  Ogre viewer but not the standard viewer).
- LookAt/TargetCamera: Added roll and up parameters.
- slparams: The slparams function now uses an internal preprocessor by default
  instead of invoking 'cpp'. This eliminates the dependency on cpp (which
  isn't available by default on Windows, for example).
- RMShader: The preprocessor that should be used during parameter extraction
  can be passed as argument.
- Material3DS: An approximation of the material can now also be seen in
  the OpenGL viewer.
- RenderMan export: The IMaterial protocol now defines functions for obtaining
  the transformation that should be applied to a shader. The RMShader class
  now has a parameter to set this transformation. This means the shader can
  be transformed relative to the object.
- New export script for 3ds max that currently exports spline shapes and
  cameras.

Bug fixes/enhancements:

- objmtl: Also allow group specifications without a name. In this case,
  the name 'default' will be used.
- GeomObject: The size of the primitive variables does not depend on the
  methods uniformCount(), varyingCount(), etc. but only on the constraints.
  So these ...Count() methods are only for informational purposes now and
  don't have to be implemented anymore by derived classes. Instead derived
  classes must implement the slotSizeConstraint() method.
- cgtypes: All the method arguments can now also be passed as keyword
  arguments (this fixes bug #1262258).
- ArraySlots: The size of ArraySlots can now be constrained (which is used
  for primitive variables). Disconnecting array slots was not properly done,
  dangling references were possible. 
- ArraySlot: Bugfix in the DataContainer object (the copy constructor
  wasn't initializing the multiplicity attribute which could lead to
  obscure and sometimes irreproducible crashes).
- ArraySlot: New method isResizable() to check if a resize() operation would
  succeed or not.
- ArraySlot/Slot: connect(), disconnect(), addDependent(), removeDependent()
  and notifyDependents() was wrapped in the wrong place (in the Slots classes
  instead of the base ISlot) which left them undefined for ArraySlots.
- TriMeshGeom/PolyhedronGeom: The array slots of primitive variables are
  now size constrained so that modifying the size of the faces/verts will
  update the size of the primitive variables accordingly.
- LightSource: The C++ base class now has a bool slot "cast_shadow" that
  enabled/disables shadows (if supported by the actual light source 
  implementation and the renderer).
- WorldObject: The Python wrappers for the worldtransform and totalmass slots
  were missing which resulted in an exception when connecting these slots
  to other slots.
- FlockOfBirds: Initialize the orientation (matrix and quat) with the
  identity instead of 0.
- Material: The applyGL() and usesBlending() methods from the GLMaterial class
  are now declared in the base Material class, so any material might be used
  with the OpenGL viewer. The methods can be implemented in Python (if derived
  from the Material base class, not the GLMaterial class).
- Maya ASF/AMC exporter: Fixes to be able to run in Maya 5.
- Ogre-Viewer: Take the fov of the camera into account / set background color
  from the global background variable.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from cgkit-2.0.0alpha3 to cgkit-2.0.0alpha4:

New features:

- The render tool can now also be used to bake texture maps
- TargetCamera/FreeCamera: New parameters nearplane, farplane, auto_nearfar
  to control the near and far clipping planes. This can be used to get rid
  of the OpenGL rendering artifacts when the camera is within the scene bounds.
  The minimum near plane distance is now a fixed value of 0.1 (previously it
  was based on the scene extents).
- cmds: New function drawText() to draw a text string at a 3D position
  (viewer only).
- New import/export plugins for PLY files (using the RPly library by 
  Diego Nehab, http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~diego/professional/rply/)
- New (partial) import plugin for Maya .ma files
- New module mayaascii to parse .ma files.
- New module simplecpp that contains a simple C preprocessor class (which
  is used in the mayaascii module)
- New class RMLightSource that wraps a RenderMan light source shader
- Slot: New method disconnect() to break connections (equivalent to
  target.setController(None))
- GLRenderer: The separation of the specular color can be enabled/disabled
  (so far only globally).
- Utilities: New MEL script for Maya to export a skeleton (and its motion)
  as ASF/AMC files (see utilities/maya). The script was written by Bert Völker.

Bug fixes/enhancements:

- Compile fixes under OSX (thanks to Tobias Sauerwein!)
- 3DS import: In some cases it could happen that an object was illegally
  created beneath the world root instead of its correct parent
- noise: The missing vector valued noise functions are now available
- ODEDynamics: Removed the numarray dependency (for now) as it wasn't used
  anyway
- cgtypes: Added pickle & copy support (which is one more step to increase
  the compatibility between the cgtypes in cgkit1 & cgkit2)
- cmds.drawClear() was broken because of a typo
- TriMeshGeom: Drawing meshes using OpenGL now supports all valid type
  combinations of "N", "st" and "Cs" (constant, uniform, varying, facevarying,
  user + facevarying faces and user + uniform faces)
- StrArraySlot class added
- GeomObject: Bugfix: Primitive variables of type string were created without
  corresponding slot.
- Slots (C++): Slot values aren't initialized with 0 anymore so that the
  templates can also be used for non-numeric values (such as strings).
- PolyhedronGeom: If there is no normal information, the normals are now 
  automatically computed for rendering.
- PolyhedronGeom: Triangulating polys that have uniform variables could
  have led to an exception being thrown.
- PolyhedronGeom: Normals, texture coords and colors stored as USER variables 
  with an additional faces variable of type FACEVARYING are now correctly 
  displayed in the viewer (previously this combination was ignored).
- Slot: Calling slot.connect(None) resulted in an unhandled C++ exception.
  This is fixed so that the call has no effect.
- Slot: Procedural slots allowed setting values which led to an inconsistent
  graph
- lib3ds wrapper: Check for the available lib3ds version so that v1.2.0
  can also be used again (however, the "self illumination percentage" 
  material attribute won't be available then).
- The C++ supportlib will be compiled with -fPIC under Linux (thanks
  to Chris Bainbridge) which fixes import errors on some systems.
- RIBExport: Only use motion blocks when there actually is a motion
- Rigid body dynamics: Disabled rigid bodies (dynamics=False) that were 
  attached to enabled rigid bodies did still influence the simulation 
  (cog, inertiatensor, collision). This is fixed now.
- Rigid bodies: The dynamics attribute is now a slot instead of just a
  Python attribute (now it can be accessed in C++).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from cgkit-2.0.0alpha2 to cgkit-2.0.0alpha3:

New features:

- New export plugin for OBJ files.
- New export plugin for OFF files.
- Improved OFF import. Normals, colors and texture coordinates are also 
  imported if present. 
- New import plugin for OBJ files.
- New module "objmtl" that contains an OBJ and MTL reader class.
- OBJMaterial: New material to store the parameters of a material definition
  as it appears in OBJ/MTL files.
- Tool: New option -t/--set-time to determine how to reach the starting time
- GnuPlotter: New options xrange, starttime, endtime.
- RIBExport: The display mode can be set via the global option "displaymode"
  (default is "rgb").
- New storage types FACEVARYING and FACEVERTEX for primitive variables
  (same semantics as in RenderMan)
- New module "application" that contains the getApp() function to obtain
  a reference to the surrounding application.
- EventManager: When connecting to an event you can now specify a priority
  which determines the calling order.
- EventManager: When an event handler returns True, the notifcation chain
  is interrupted (i.e. the event is consumed).
- The GL light sources now also have an "ambient" color attribute
- Instead of a single material you can now also pass a sequence of materials
  into the constructor of the world objects
- New polyhedron geometry
- Python import: The directory where the input file is located is added
  to the module import path so that local modules can be imported as usual.
- ODEDynamics: The add() method now has optional arguments categorybits and
  collidebits to control collision detection
- ODEBodyManipulator: Forces/Torques can be relative and forces can be 
  applied at a particular position. New attributes: body, odebody
- TargetCamera/FreeCamera: New method eyeRay() to obtain the ray from the
  eye position through an image point.
- Joint: Local coordinate frame can now be arbitrarily oriented. Order of
  rotation can be specified.
- New import plugin for ASF/AMC files (using the new asfamc module)
- New import plugin for BVH files (using the new bvh module)
- New module "bvh" that contains a Biovision Hierarchical (BVH) reader class
- New module "asfamc" that contains base classes for reading 
  Acclaim Skeleton File Definition (ASF) files and 
  Acclaim Motion Capture Data (AMC) files.
- OGRE-Viewer: New functionality for swapping scene graphs

Bug fixes/enhancements:

- Scene: walkWorld() can also be used to traverse a subtree of the scene
- EventManager: There was a bug in the disconnect() method that always
  resulted in an exception.
- Group: The children can also be specified by name
- viewer: The order of operation within a frame has changed. The scene is
  now displayed at the beginning of the frame (so that processing events
  and the STEP_FRAME event are together).
- GnuPlotter: There seems to be a bug in Gnuplot.py that produces an exception
  when only one data item is being plotted. The GnuPlotter component now
  contains a workaround.
- Expression: When a user variable was called 'v' the expression didn't work.
- IArraySlots: New method copyValues() to copy the values of an ArraySlot 
  without having to know its exact type.
- ArraySlots: Array access wasn't range checked which could lead to a crash.
  This is fixed now + some additional type checking.
- ArraySlots: The getValues()/setValues() methods have been removed on the
  Python side. Instead getValue()/setValue() can be used (on the C++ side
  the distinction is still there).
- CamControl: Camera control doesn't raise an exception anymore when used
  with a FreeCamera. However, the control might not be usable in all 
  situations (especially rotations). Needs more attention.
- quat: quat.fromAngleAxis() won't generate an exception anymore if the
  axis is zero. This case is now treated as if angle was zero and returns
  (1,0,0,0). The axis also doesn't have to be normalized anymore.
  (support request #1144713)
- supportlib/wrapper: Compile fixes for gcc 3.4 (under FreeBSD). Thanks
  to Clive Crous.
  (bug report #1143768)
- mat3: Changed the meaning of the fromEuler???() methods. The order now
  refers to the *local* axes instead of the global axes as before. This
  means that if you want to get the previous behavior you have to invert 
  the order. NOTE: This also affects other classes such as the Joint class
  or the EulerAdapter.
- OGRE-Viewer: Various bug fixes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from cgkit-2.0.0alpha1 to cgkit-2.0.0alpha2:

New features:

- New module "glove" that wraps the 5DT Data Glove SDK
- New module "wintab" that wraps the Wintab API
- New module "spacedevice" that wraps the 3Dconnexion 3DXWare SDK
- The viewer generates SpaceMouse/SpaceBall and tablet events
- New class: FreeCamera
- STL importer added (ASCII and binary)
- 3DS import: "parent" option added. The entire scene will be loaded as 
  children of the specified parent.
- viewer.py: Most options can now be set in the Globals section of the scene 
- viewer.py: Background color can be set with the global option "background"
- GLTexture: Image may also be passed as raw RGB data
- OGRE-Viewer: Automatic smoothing when normals are not specified. New option 
  -B/--debug-mode to enable debug output. Shadow technique is now "additive".

Bugfixes:

- The view transformation of the camera was using the local transform instead
  of the world transform (i.e. attaching the camera to other objects didn't
  work as expected)
- ODEDynamics: The time step was only taken during initialization and
  could be wrong if it was changed afterwards.
- 3DS import: Meshes without corresponding Node (as generated by Wings 3D,
  for example) will now be imported, too.
- cgtypes.quat: fromMat() is now more robust to numerical inaccuracies
- RIB export: Hierarchies with pivot frames != id were incorrectly transformed
- OGRE-Viewer: Compile fixes for Linux (gcc). Bugfix: The viewer crashed
  when using non-OpenGL light sources. 
- supportlib: When a new controller for a slot was set, there were 
  situations where the onValueChanged() notification was issued twice.
  This should be fixed now.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Beginning of cgkit2 (2.0.0alpha1) - Major changes from cgkit1 to cgkit2:

 - There's a support library written in C++ (which is independent of Python)
 - Switched from Pyrex to Boost.Python
 - cgtypes rewrite: The classes now wrap their corresponding C++ classes
 - The noise module is now wrapped using Boost.Python instead of the raw
   C/Python API
 - Additional modules that allow the creation and manipulation of 3D data
   in memory. This is now the biggest part of the kit and it turns Python 
   into a scripting language like MEL or MaxScript.
 - The kit contains tools to visualize a 3D scene either interactively
   or via RenderMan

######################################################################

Changes from cgkit-1.1.0 to cgkit-1.2.0:

- ri.py: RiEnd() now always flushes the internal buffer
- ri.py: Bugfix: RiLightSource() didn't handle parameters passed inside a
  dictionary.
- cgtypes: Fixed a typo in quat.fromMat() that was generating a NameError in
  certain cases.


Changes from cgkit-1.0.1 to cgkit-1.1.0:

- New module "cgkitinfo" that contains release information
- New module "slparams" that can extract RenderMan shader parameters 
  from shader source files.
- sltokenize: Bugfix: The filename that was passed to the tokeneater was
  containing a trailing apostroph.
- cgtypes: 
  * quat.fromAngleAxis() and the corresponding constructor now return a 
    unit quaternion.
  * New method quat.dot() that calculates the dot product
  * New methods quat.exp() and quat.log()
  * Quats now support the pow() function and ** operator
  * Two new functions: slerp() and squad() to do quaternion interpolation
    (Thanks to Max Rheiner)
- ri.py: The "version" call in the output stream can be suppressed by
  calling RiOption(RI_RIBOUTPUT, RI_VERSION, 0) directly after RiBegin()
  is called.
  (Thanks to Moritz Möller)
- ri.py: Support for RIB string handles. RiLightSource, RiAreaLightSource and
  RiObjectBegin support the parameter "__handleid" (RI_HANDLEID) which can be
  used to support a user defined string handle. RiIlluminate and 
  RiObjectInstance were modified accordingly so that they can take string 
  handles.
  (Thanks to Moritz Möller)
- ri.py: The version number in the RIB stream is now set to 3.03 instead
  of 3.2 as this version is not the version of the RI specification but the
  version of the Byte Stream protocol.
  (Thanks to Moritz Möller)
 

Changes from cgkit-1.0 to cgkit-1.0.1:

- The binary file for Python 2.2 was broken and the source zip contained
  a modified version of cgtypes.c (which was necessary for Python 2.3, 
  Pyrex 0.8.2 and VC6, but didn't work on Linux).

Changes from cgkit-1.0beta3 to cgkit-1.0:

- sl.py: Function ptlined() added.
- sl.py: Doc strings added.
- cgtypes: mat4: Added a new method orthographic() which is equivalent
         to the OpenGL command glOrtho().
- ri.py: The output of any initial RiArchvieRecord() calls will be placed
         *before* the version information. 
- ri.py: RiBegin() doesn't output any header information automatically 
         anymore, you have to do that manually. However, you can use the
         new utility function RiuDefaultHeader() to output a couple of 
         entries that can be determined automatically.
- ri.py: RiArchiveRecord() allows variables $DATE, $CREATOR, $USER in its
         format string.
- ri.py: Passing an empty string to RiBegin() has the same effect as
         passing RI_NULL (the stream will be written to stdout).
- ri.py: vec3 values can now be used as any 3-sequence.
- ri.py: vec3 values can now be used as colors (this wasn't possible because
         vec3 doesn't support slicing). 
- ri.py: The values of RI_KA, RI_KD, RI_KS and RI_KR are now upper-case.
- riutil: New function RiuDefaultHeader() which outputs a default header at
         the top of the RIB stream.
- riutil: RiuCoordSystem() takes a shader name as optional argument. 
- riutil: RiuGrid() takes the number of cells, the shader name and the color
          as optional arguments.
- sltokenize: Finished tokenizer. Now it actually does what the 
         documentation says.


Changes from cgkit-1.0beta2 to cgkit-1.0beta3:

- noise: Small change in the noise_template function so that older gcc 
  versions will also compile the module.
- Rewrite of cgtypes using Pyrex to speed up the types. The old pure 
  Python cgtypes are still available in pycgtypes.
  New in cgtypes:
  * Comparisons are using an epsilon environment. The threshold can be
    read and written using getEpsilon() and setEpsilon().
  * vec3/vec4: All comparison operators are supported now (== != < <= > >=)
  * vec4: The 4th component can be accessed either by name "w" or "t"
  * mat3/mat4: All methods taking vec3s as input also accept other
    3-sequences such as ordinary tuples or lists.
  * mat4: The index operator returns a vec4 when called with a single int.
  * mat4.perspective() was broken
  * New method mat4.setMat3()


Changes from cgkit-1.0beta1 to cgkit-1.0beta2:

- noise: On Linux the noise module couldn't be imported because the modules'
  init function couldn't be found. This was due to C++ name mangling. 
  For some reason, this was no problem under Windows.
- noise: Complete rewrite of the noise function. Now there are separate
  implementations for 2D,3D and 4D.
- noise: New functions: pnoise(), spnoise, cellnoise(), scellnoise(), 
  fBm(), turbulence(),
  vnoise(), vsnoise(), vpnoise(), vspnoise(), vcellnoise(), vscellnoise(), 
  vfBm(), vturbulence()
- sl.py: Added cellnoise and pnoise
- vec4.py: Method normalize() added
- ri.py: Bugfix in RiSolidBegin(): Apostrophes were missing in output
- riutil.py: Can be imported even if PIL is not installed. The exception
  will only be raised if a function is called that actually depends on PIL.
