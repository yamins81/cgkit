Preliminaries
-------------

Before you can render any images you actually need a renderer that has
to be available on your system. For this tutorial, this has to be
a RenderMan compliant renderer such as, for example, PRMan_, Air_, 
RenderDotC_ or one of the freely available renderers such as
Aqsis_, Pixie_ or 3Delight_.

Additionally, there has to be a C preprocessor (cpp) on your system
if you are using the RMMaterial class which is done later in the
tutorial (the preprocessor is used to prepare a shader source file
for parsing). If you are on Linux you'll most certainly have one 
installed already (just try to invoke ``cpp``), on Windows it might
be that your renderer provides such a preprocessor (as BMRT once did).
If not, you can try the tools from MinGW_ or Cygwin_.

Rendering an image
------------------

Rendering an image "offline" virtually works the same as visualizing
it with the interactive viewer tool. The only difference is that you
visualize the scene with a different tool, namely the *render*
tool. For example, here is a simple scene (simplescene.py_,
uvmap.png_) visualized with the viewer tool::

  $ viewer.py simplescene.py

.. image:: rm_viewer.jpg
.. _simplescene.py: simplescene.py
.. _uvmap.png: uvmap.png

To get a rendered version of the above scene we simply switch the tool::

  $ render.py simplescene.py

.. image:: rm_render.jpg

The resulting image is a smooth version of the image produced by the 
viewer tool where the sphere is really a sphere and not a tesselated
version of a sphere and where the geometry is antialiased. 

By default, the render tool will try to use Aqsis for rendering the image.
You can switch to another renderer with the --renderer/-r option::

  $ render.py --renderer=3delight simplescene.py
  $ render.py -rpixie simplescene.py

You can change the default renderer by setting the -r option in the
environment variable ``RENDER_DEFAULT_OPTIONS``::

  $ set RENDER_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=-r3delight

(the actual command depends on your operating system and shell)

As you could see above, the viewer and render tool both work with the
same input data, so creating a scene for rendering an image is exactly
the same as creating a scene for the interactive viewer. This means,
you can always use the viewer tool to preview your scenes.  And as
each tool does not only accept Python files you can render any 3D file
that is supported by cgkit. In the following example, the render tool
was used to render a 3DS file (the model was downloaded from
http://www.3dheaven.net/)::

  $ render.py awing.3ds

.. image:: awing_aqsis.jpg

In the case of the 3DS format, the render tool even creates shaders
that mimic the appearance of the materials in the file. Here is
the same scene as above rendered with 3D Studio MAX instead of Aqsis:

.. image:: awing_max.jpg

The render tool hides all the details that have to be dealt with
before a scene can be rendered. This involves the following steps:

- Creating a RIB file from the current scene
- Translating the materials into RenderMan shaders
- Converting & copying image maps
- Compiling the shaders
- Invoking the renderer
- TODO: Converting the output image if necessary / creating an animation file

If you have tried one of the above examples yourself, you might have
noticed that the render tool has created some new files and directories.
The actual scene file for the renderer is the file ``main.rib`` in the current
directory. If you want to rerender the scene you can simply pass this
RIB file to the renderer. Then there are the additional directories
``geoms``, ``maps`` and ``shaders`` which contain the translated geometry
(one file per GeomObject used), the maps that were either used as input
or generated during rendering and the generated shaders. 

Materials vs Shaders
--------------------

Before invoking the renderer the render tool generates RenderMan shaders
on the fly. Each material may spawn up to three shaders: a surface shader,
a displacement shader and an interior shader. Usually, any material that
comes with cgkit may be used for RenderMan as well. That's why in the
first example a GLMaterial (and GL light sources) which is actually intended
to be used together with the interactive viewer tool could also be used to
render an image via RenderMan. However, the generated shaders are not
very flexible as they just simulate the standard OpenGL lighting model.

As of this writing there isn't yet a standard material dedicated to
offline renderings. So far, the closest thing to that is the
``Material3DS`` class which stores (and its shaders partly
approximate) the material parameters as they are stored in a 3DS file
(the corresponding light source is the ``SpotLight3DS``).

Of course, you still have the liberty to write your own shaders from
scratch. That's where the ``RMMaterial`` class comes into play. This
class wraps external RenderMan shader files that you can create with your
favorite text editor or shader creation tool. The shader will 
automatically be compiled and its parameters will be made available as
slots.

The following material definition just uses the standard RenderMan
``constant`` shader:

.. code-block:: Python

  mat = RMMaterial( 
            surface = "constant",
            color   = (0.6, 0.5, 0.8)
  )

The *surface* parameter specifies the surface shader that you want to use
and it can either be a string as above or an instance of the ``RMShader``
class:

.. code-block:: Python

  mat = RMMaterial( 
            surface = RMShader("plastic", Kd=0.8, Ks=0.5),
            color   = (0.6, 0.5, 0.8)
  )

Using a RMShader object has the advantage that you can pass shader
arguments to the shader. In the first example you could only
specify the color (and opacity) which are separate RenderMan calls
that can be accessed by *all* shaders that make up a material
(surface, displacement, interior). That's why they are specified
as parameters of the entire material and not of an individual shader.

In the above examples, the actual shader was specified by just
providing its name. In that case, the material doesn't know where the
actual shader source file is located and you have to compile the
shaders yourself and make sure that the renderer will find it (above,
we have ensured these things because we were using standard RenderMan
shaders that every renderer must support to be RenderMan compliant).
Another thing is that the material won't know the types of the shader
parameters which means you have to declare them yourself if you are
using non-standard parameters.

Here is another example that looks almost the same as above but is quite
a bit different:

.. code-block:: Python

  mat = RMMaterial(
            surface = RMShader("shaders/mysurface.sl"),
            color   = (0.6, 0.5, 0.8)
  )

The only difference is that instead of a raw shader name, the actual
shader source file is given. As the material object now knows where
the source file is located it will take care of the compilation itself.
Additionally, it will read the file and extract the parameters of the
shader and make them available as slots. So you can animate the shader
parameters like any other parameter in your scene. Let's do an example.
The following is a simple shader that just creates a noise pattern without any
illumination:

.. code-block:: CPP

  // Surface shader "mysurface.sl"

  surface mysurface(float freq=1.0; float amp=1.0)
  {
    Ci = amp*color "rgb" noise(freq*P);
    Oi = 1;
  }

You can use this shader as follows:

.. code-block:: Python

  mat = RMMaterial(
            surface = RMShader("mysurface.sl", freq=2.0, amp=1.5)
  )

  Sphere( material=mat )

If you render this scene you get the following image:

.. image:: shaderdemo.jpg

Note that you didn't have to compile the shader yourself as you were
specifying the shader *source file*. Also note that you didn't have to
declare the shader parameters in the RMShader constructor because
their type is already known to the material by inspecting the source
file. You can also read or write the parameters after construction
like this:

.. code-block:: Python

  mat.freq = 1.7
  mat.amp = 0.5

Or connect the values to other values in your scene:

.. code-block:: Python

  e = Expression("cos(t)")
  e.output_slot.connect(mat.amp_slot)

In this example, the shader parameters have been accessed directly via the
material object. As long as all shader parameter names are unique, you
can access the parameters of all three shaders via the material. But if,
for example, the surface shader and the displacement shader of one material
use parameters with the same name, then you will only be able to access
the surface shader parameters via the material. The displacement shader
parameters are shadowed in that case. In such cases you have to take one
additional indirection and specify that you want to manipulate the
parameter of the displacement shader:

.. code-block:: Python

  mat = RMMaterial(
            surface = RMShader("mysurface.sl"),
            displacement = RMShader("mydisplacement.sl"),
	    displacementbound = ("current", 1.0)
  )

  # Set the freq parameter of the surface shader
  mat.freq = 5.0
  # Same as above as the surface shader has a higher priority anyway
  mat.surface.freq = 5.0
  # Set the freq parameter of the displacement shader
  mat.displacement.freq = 5.0


Using external RIB files
------------------------

When you create images with cgkit and RenderMan you'll typically use
some kind of modeling tool to create your assets and then use Python
and the cgkit to manipulate some aspects of your scene or just use the
render tool to invoke the renderer.

With this approach there has to be a way to get your models from your
modeling tool into cgkit. If your modeling tool can export your models
into a format that cgkit can import then you can simply use the
``load()`` command to load the model and then modify it accordingly
(such as changing materials, for example). However, this is not always
the best way as it might reduce the quality of the models in some
situations.  For example, if your model is composed of NURBS patches
and you export it as a 3DS file it will be tesselated into a triangle
mesh as this is the only type of geometry that a 3DS file can store.
However, if your modeling tool can already export as RIB, then you
can use the ``RIBArchive`` class to include the model into your scene.
You can't use the load() command as cgkit cannot import RIB as of this
writing. And even if it will some day, it might happen that your RIB file
contains some stuff that cgkit won't understand. So the RIBArchive approach
will still be desirable as it blindly includes any RIB you're passing in
(it doesn't have to parse and understand the file itself).

Here is an example how you would include the file ``mymodel.rib`` to
your scene (note that you'll only see the model when rendered with
the render tool. In the interactive viewer tool it will be invisible
as the file isn't read by cgkit):

.. code-block:: Python

  RIBArchive(
      filename = "mymodel.rib"
  )

The RIB file should only contain the raw geometry. You can then still
assign cgkit materials to the model or position it in your world.


Rendering animations
--------------------

By default, the render tool renders the first frame of an animation.
You can set a different frame using the -b/--begin option. If you also set
the -e/--end option the tool will render the entire range.
Each option takes a time as argument which can be specified either as
a frame number or a time value in seconds::

  # Render frames 10 to 25
  render.py myanim.py -b10 -e25

  # Render the time interval 1.0 second to 2.5 seconds
  render.py myanim.py -b1s -e2.5s

As soon as you use the -e option the frame number will be appended to the
output file name.
