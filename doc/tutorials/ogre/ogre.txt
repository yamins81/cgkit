The "Ogre Viewer" ist based on the C++ library OGRE v0.15, see
http://www.ogre3d.org/ for more details about OGRE.

Basically, you can do everything with the ogre-viewer as with the
normal viewer and as it is just wrapped C++ code, it is even faster
when rendering complex scenes and capable of nice effects like
shadows, special shaders, multiple renderpasses, etc.. It also
supports DirectX as well as OpenGL.

A. Rendering with OGRE-Materials
--------------------------------

.. _First Steps: ../first_steps/first_steps.html

So as you did in the `First Steps`_ tutorial, create a new scene called
``helloOgre.py``.  The file should look like this:

.. code-block:: Python

  TargetCamera(
      pos    = (3,2,2),
      target = (0,0,0)
  )

  GLPointLight(
      pos       = (0, 0, 4),
      diffuse   = (0.9, 0.2, 0.2)
  )

  GLPointLight(
      pos       = (0, 0, -4),
      diffuse   = (0.2, 0.0, 0.9)
  )

  Box(
      name      = "MyBox",
      material  = GLMaterial( diffuse = ( 0.2, 0.6, 0.2 ) ) 
  )

So, like the helloworld.py scene, it consists of just two pointlights,
a camera and a box.

Render the scene with the ogre-viewer::

  viewerOgre.py -d helloOgre.py

You will notice that the ogre-rendered scene doesn't take the
materials green diffuse component into account, as you will notice
just the red and the blue lights at the top and the bottom (remember,
you can move around in the scene with the ALT key and the mouse
buttons). It's because OGRE handles materials differently (in respect
to the standard viewer). You have to create a special material script
in which you specify colours, passes, pixel- and vertex shaders and
whole fallback techniques.

Go into your materials directory (subdirectory of "demosOgre") and
create a file called ``"MyFirstMaterial.material"``, that looks like
this:

.. code-block:: CPP

  material MyFirstMaterial
  { 
      // first, preferred technique
      technique
      {
          // first pass
          pass
          {
               diffuse 0.2 0.6 0.2
          }
      }
  }

Save it and add to your ``helloOgre.py`` the following lines:

.. code-block:: Python

  listWorld()
  b = worldObject("MyBox")
  b.setMaterial( Material( "MyFirstMaterial" ) )

Another way to do the same would be to replace the line:

.. code-block:: Python

  material  = GLMaterial( diffuse = ( 0.2, 0.6, 0.2 ) )

with

.. code-block:: Python

  material = Material( "MyFirstMaterial")

Render the scene again with the ogre-viewer, and you will see, that
the green material component is now taken into account::

  viewerOgre.py -d helloOgre.py

When OGRE can't find the material, or it is not supported by your
graphics hardware, it will assign a standard bright white
material, that's why it has been much brighter before.

For more information about using OGRE materials consult the manual at
http://www.ogre3d.org/docs/manual/manual_16.html#SEC25.

B. Shadows, Pixel Shader, Vertex Shader
---------------------------------------

The ogre-viewer is internally controlled by an OgreCore Object that
encapsulates all needed functionality for setup and rendering.

Normally, there is no need to touch the viewerOgre sourcecode - you
can pass the most important spects as parameters. You can switch
between "use shadows" (default) "no shadows" (-d). Keep in mind that
OGRE needs all meshes to be manifold in order to render shadows
correctly. If you are running the library under Windows and have
DirectX installed, you can try switching to DirectX rendering mode (-R
d3d).

Type::

  viewerOgre.py --help 

to get a list for all optional parameters.

Let's create a scene and check out shadow effects. Create a file
called ogreShadows.py that looks like this:

.. code-block:: Python

  TargetCamera(
      name   = "MyCam",
      pos    = (9,6,6),
      target = (0,0,0) 
  )

  GLPointLight(
      pos       = (0, 0, 4),
      diffuse   = (1, 1, 1) 
  )

  GLPointLight(
      pos       = (4, 4, 4),
      diffuse   = (1, 1, 1)  
  )

  Box(
      pos       = (2, 2, 0),
      name      = "MyBox1" 
  )

  Box(
      pos       = (-1, -1, 0),
      scale     = (3, 2, 2),
      name      = "MyBox2"
  )

  Box(
      pos       = (4, 4, -2),
      scale     = (3, 2, 1),
      name      = "MyBox3" 
  )

  Box(
      pos       = (0, 0, -2),
      scale     = (20, 20, 0.2),
      name      = "MyBoxPlane" 
  )

There are three boxes that will cast shadows on the groundplane and on
themselves. The OGRE stencil shadow implementation supports
self shadowing for single objects.

The scene looks still pretty boring. Let's make a simple animation:

.. code-block:: Python

  def object_path(time=0.0):
      w = 2.5 * time
      return vec3(0.5*sin(w), 0.5*cos(w), 0)

  ObjPath = createFunctionComponent(object_path)
  path = ObjPath()
  timer.time_slot.connect(path.time_slot)

  box = worldObject("MyBox2")
  path.output_slot.connect(box.pos_slot)

This connects the output slot of the FunctionComponent ``ObjPath`` to
the position slot of ``"MyBox2"``, thus making it update its position
whenever ``ObjPath`` changes its output. So, the box will be hovering
over the ground, as the z-coordinate remains constant. This way, you
can quickly do a lot of simple animations.

The next step is to add a simple fragment shader (aka pixel shader)
and a simple vertex shader.  Firstly, go into your material script
``"MyFirstMaterial.material"``.  In order to use shaders, you have to
declare them here first:

.. code-block:: CPP

  fragment_program firstFragmentProgram cg
  {
      source firstFragmentProgram.cg
      entry_point main
      profiles ps_2_0 arbfp1
  }

  vertex_program firstVertexProgram cg
  {
      source firstVertexProgram.cg
      entry_point main
      profiles vs_2_0 arbvp1
  }

Declaring them is easily done by specifying <shader type> <name>
<format of shader> (e.g. ``vertex_program firstVertexProgram cg``). You
also have to declare (for cg shaders) the entry point and the profiles
to which they should be compiled. Note that you may have difficulties
with the profiles, depending on your graphics hardware. ``ps_2_0`` for
example means pixelshader 2.0 (for DirectX), that is only available on
fully directX 9.0 compatible graphic cards (like ATI Radeon 9500 and
better), while ``arbfp1`` is an OpenGL pendant for fragment programs of
this class. Remember that for cg shaders, the amount of calculations
and functions you may use depends on your selected profiles, so it's a
good practice to always testcompile them before starting.

The actual shader implementations are in special files that are
defined with the ``"source"`` keyword. You may also make a hierarchy like
``shaders/firstVertexProgram.cg``.  So create these two files
``"firstFragmentProgram.cg"`` and ``"firstVertexProgram.cg"`` and make
them look like this:

.. code-block:: CPP

  // firstVertexProgram.cg
  void main( float4 position       : POSITION,
             float4 normal         : NORMAL,
             out float4 oPosition  : POSITION,
             out float4 color      : COLOR,
	     out float4  magic     : TEXCOORD0,
             uniform float4x4 modelViewProj,
             uniform float4x4 modelView )
  {
      color = magic;
      oPosition = mul(modelViewProj, position);
  }

  // firstFragmentProgram.cg
  void main( float4 color      : COLOR,
             float4 position   : POSITION,
             float4 magicIn    : TEXCOORD0,
             out float4 oCol   : COLOR )
  {
      magic = mul(modelView, position);
      color = magic;
      oPosition = mul(modelViewProj, position);
  }

These are very simple programs and are just adjusting color and
position (while the color depends on the world- and view
matrices). So, the next step is to assign these programs in a material
pass and to provide the two extern parameters to the shader, namely
``modelViewProj`` and ``modelView``.

This is done in the base material script again, here is how the full
script file should look like:

.. code-block:: CPP

  fragment_program firstFragmentProgram cg
  {
      source firstFragmentProgram.cg
      entry_point main
      profiles ps_2_0 arbfp1
  }

  vertex_program firstVertexProgram cg
  {
      source firstVertexProgram.cg
      entry_point main
      profiles vs_2_0 arbvp1
  }

  material MyFirstMaterial
  {
      // first, preferred technique
      technique
      {
          // first pass
          pass
          {
               diffuse 0.2 0.9 0.2

              // reference to your vertex program in the pass
              vertex_program_ref firstVertexProgram
              {

                  // with need to update regularly
                  // syntax: param_named_auto <name> <code> <extra params>
                  param_named_auto modelViewProj   WORLDVIEWPROJ_MATRIX
                  param_named_auto modelView       WORLDVIEW_MATRIX
              }

              // reference to your fragment program in the pass
              fragment_program_ref firstFragmentProgram
              {
		    // no parameters needed
              }	
          }
      }
  }

Now, you have created references to your cg programs (you instanced
them) and provided the two required matrices as parameters. To see how
OGRE material scripts handles parameters, parameter types and what
parameters are available, consult the OGRE manual.

Now it is time to assign the material to your objects. This is again
done in your scene ``"ogreShadows.py"``:

.. code-block:: Python

  box = worldObject("MyBox1")
  box.setMaterial(Material("MyFirstMaterial"))
  box = worldObject("MyBox2")
  box.setMaterial(Material("MyFirstMaterial"))
  box = worldObject("MyBox3")
  box.setMaterial(Material("MyFirstMaterial"))
  box = worldObject("MyBoxPlane")
  box.setMaterial(Material("MyFirstMaterial"))

And add an animated camera to the scene like you did before with the
box, this will make the camera rotate around your nice set of (now
wildly coloured) cubes:

.. code-block:: Python

  def cam_path(time=0.0):
      w = 0.5*time
      a = 14
      return vec3(a*sin(w), a*cos(w), 2)

  CamPath = createFunctionComponent(cam_path)
  path = CamPath()
  timer.time_slot.connect(path.time_slot)

  cam = worldObject("MyCam")
  path.output_slot.connect(cam.pos_slot)

Render the scene with shadows enabled and shadows disabled and notice
the difference. As stencil shadows are computed on the cpu, remember
that when modifying vertices position differently (in a vertex shader)
than the the fixed-function pipeline does, they are not taken into
account, as the cpu doesn't know about the modified vertices.

Remember that the vertex and pixel shader overwrite all information
given by the material script before. This means, that the diffuse
component specified in the pass has absolutely no effect on the actual
color of the cube. Additionally you have to make all the calculation,
as would have the fixed-function pipeline without programs. This
means, that you have to calculate the right coordinates and color
values depending on what you want to do. E.g. replacing the line:

.. code-block:: CPP

  oPosition = mul(modelViewProj, position); 

with

.. code-block:: CPP

  oPosition = position; 

in the vertex shader would mean that all coordinates would remain in
modelspace, without any transformations.

That's it, to be honest, the shaders created here are not very fancy
or logical, but they should be a guide for further and complicated
shader proramming and are intended to show some common problems and
obstacles when starting with shaders for the first time.
