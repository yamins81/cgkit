This tutorial will explain the different options you have when you
want to add custom attributes to objects. You can access custom attributes
in your Python code or in RenderMan shaders.


Standard Python attributes
--------------------------

The first and easiest option you have when you want to create a new 
attribute is the regular Python attribute access. You can add a new
attribute just by assigning it to an object::

  >>> from cgkit.all import *
  >>> s = Sphere()
  >>> hasattr(s, "spam")
  False
  >>> s.spam = "This is a new attribute"
  >>> hasattr(s, "spam")
  True
  >>> print s.spam
  This is a new attribute  

All this is just regular Python stuff that can be used with most Python
objects. However, there are a few disadvantages with this approach:

- The new attribute isn't animatable via the usual slot mechanism.
- The C++ part of cgkit (or any external C++ code) can only access the
  attribute via the Python/C API which will slow it down.
- You can only store one value per object whereas you might want to store
  one value per "subobject" such as faces or vertices.

The next sections will tell you how to remedy these deficiencies.


Custom slots
------------

Instead of just creating a regular Python attribute that holds the
desired value, you can create a *slot* that will hold the value.
For example, let's equip the OpenGL point light with an attribute
that holds the number of photons to emit (which might be used by
an export plugin that exports into a scene description of a global
illumination renderer):: 

  >>> lgt = GLPointLight()
  >>> lgt.photons_slot = IntSlot(10000)
  >>> lgt.addSlot("photons", lgt.photons_slot)

Here, we create an integer slot that will hold a value of 10000 as default
value. The last line makes the slot available for everyone else to query::

  >>> for s in lgt.iterSlots(): print s
  ...
  angularvel
  cog
  constant_attenuation
  diffuse
  enabled
  inertiatensor
  intensity
  linear_attenuation
  linearvel
  mass
  photons                <------ here is our new slot
  pos
  quadratic_attenuation
  rot
  scale
  specular
  totalmass
  transform
  visible
  worldtransform

...[**TODO**: *add a paragraph about how to read and write the value.
Future versions of cgkit might automatically make the value available
as "photons" attribute. Currently, you have to create this property
yourself (by using the slotPropertyCode() function, for example.*]...

An export plugin might now test each light source for the photons
slot and use its value if it's available, otherwise it can just use a
default value::

  ...
  if lgt.hasSlot("photons"):
      photons = lgt.photons_slot.getValue()
  else:
      photons = default_value
  ...


By using a slot class to store the attribute we can now animate the value
just like every other value by connecting it with another slot.
Furthermore, the attribute is now visible to C++ code and no Python
code has to be executed if a C++ component reads or sets the value
of the attribute (the C++ code to test for the photons attribute would
be quite similar than the above Python example).

Note however, that you can't use this approach with *every* object there 
is. The object has to be a *component* object (or derived from it such
as any world object).


Primitive variables
-------------------

In the above examples, the new attribute always just carried *one* value
(which might have been a list or a tuple, but even then it's still just
one isolated list or tuple) that belonged to the object where it was
added. However, sometimes you want to have a finer granularity when
you add an attribute to a geometric object. The value of the attribute
might depend on where you actually are on the surface of your geometry.
Suppose you want to render an outdoor scene where it's snowing and you
want to store the amount of snow that an object has accumulated. It's
obvious that the amount of snow is not constant all over a surface. Only
those surface areas can accumulate snow that "see" the sky, i.e. the snow
flakes are not blocked. So if your geometry is a triangle mesh you want to 
create *one* variable that stores a different value for every face or 
vertex of the mesh. This type of variable is called a *primitive variable*
and is a specialty of a GeomObject class. The GeomObject classes have
special methods to manipulate primitive variables. Here is an example
of a mesh that will get a new "snow" attribute::

  >>> m = TriMesh()
  >>> m.verts.resize(4)

First, we create an empty mesh and resize the number of vertices so
that the new variable will hold some values. Now we create the new
"snow" variable::

  >>> m.geom.newVariable("snow", VARYING, FLOAT)
  >>> for v in m.geom.iterVariables(): print v
  ...
  ('snow', cgkit._core.VarStorage.VARYING, cgkit._core.VarType.FLOAT, 1)

In this case, the variable would hold one floating point value per
vertex. It's one value per *vertex* as we have declared it as being of
storage class VARYING. If you would only want one value per face you
would specify UNIFORM. Other possibilities are CONSTANT, VERTEX and
USER. When iterating over the variables you just get the declaration
as a tuple. The fourth value in the tuple is the *multiplicity*. Our
snow variable just contains one value per vertex. Sometimes you want
to store an array per vertex in which case the multiplicity would be
greater than 1 (for example, texture coordinates are defined as "varying
float[2]").

You have seen how to create a new primitive variable, but you haven't seen
yet how to read or write the individual values. Calling the newVariable()
method will also create a new slot with the same name::

  >>> for s in m.geom.iterSlots(): print s
  ...
  cog
  faces
  inertiatensor
  snow
  verts

Actually, this is not a regular slot but an *array slot*. That's why it
can store one value per vertex. From here on, accessing the primitive
variable values is not any different from accessing any other array slot::

  >>> snow = m.geom.slot("snow")
  >>> snow[2] = 0.7
  >>> print snow[2]
  0.7
  >>> for v in snow: print v
  ...
  0.0
  0.0
  0.7
  0.0

As you can see you can use an array slot just like a list. The index into
the list is the index of the vertex to which the snow value belongs (or in 
case of UNIFORM variables it would be the face index).

Primitive variables are also available in RenderMan shaders. Whenever you
render a scene using the render tool any previously created primitive
variable will be attached to the exported geometry. This means, you simply
have to declare the variable as parameter of your shader and it will
automatically receive the values you've set in your Python scene. A shader
that uses the above snow value would look like this::

  surface snowy( ...other parameters...; 
                 varying float snow = 0.0; )
  {
    ...
  }

Note that you have to use the same storage class and type as before,
otherwise you'll get an error during rendering.

Standard variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are a number of standard variables that are used by the various
components of cgkit. For example, the viewer tool will use normals,
texture coordinates or color values if they are available on a mesh.
The following table gives an overview of the standard variables:

========  ================  ======================
Variable  Declaration       Description
========  ================  ======================
N         varying normal    Normals
st        varying float[2]  Texture coordinates
Cs        varying color     Colors
matid     uniform int       Material IDs per face
========  ================  ======================

For triangle meshes, there's the convention that in case of a
"varying" variable this variable can also be stored as "user" in which
case there must also be a variable "uniform int <name>faces[3]" that
contains the value indices for the three vertices. For example, you
can either have one "varying float[2] st" variable or a "user float[2] st"
variable in addition to the "uniform int stfaces[3]" variable. This
enables you to share texture coordinates among vertices.
Alternatively, you can also store those variables as "facevarying"
variables.

The variable "matid" selects one of the materials of the world object
that should be used for a particular face of a triangle mesh.
